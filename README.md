# Sri-lanka Vaccination Management System (SLVMS)
## Summary 
The proposed system is a mobile application to manage COVID-19 vaccination in Sri 
Lanka. The application is built to improve the livelihood of Sri Lankan citizens. The 
details are accessible in a QR form, so places where vaccination certificates are 
required become a hassle-free experience. The application is built to provide each 
citizen with their vaccination details which contain information such as the location of 
where the citizen has taken the vaccine and information about the given vaccine. The 
app allows the citizen to search for the nearest vaccination centre and book an 
appointment and provides a way to manage the appointments as well. The app is fully 
equipped to provide the citizens with various information related to the COVID-19
pandemic to keep citizens up to date. The mobile application is managed by a web 
application where the admin and medical staff have various levels of authorization for 
their respective roles. The entire system is made as a distributed system to prevent 
system-wide downtime and to handle enormous amounts of traffic.

## System Objectives
Vaccine Management System (VMS) is mainly a mobile application for citizens and a 
website for the vaccination teams. VMS promises to deliver authentic proof that a 
person is vaccinated directly from the vaccination database through a QR code. The 
app is designed to show all the vaccination details of the user, including the place a
person got the jab, vaccine type, batch, etc. These details are derived directly from the 
'government vaccination' database.
The application promises to help the Sri Lankan citizen's by 
• Eliminating the need to carry a physical document by introducing a digital
vaccination certificate.
• Providing an authentic document with a QR code directly from the 
'government vaccination' database.
• Reducing the hassle caused at the airport and improving travellers' quality of 
life abroad.
• Providing accurate information on covid vaccination centres.
• Providing a more trustable source to verify citizens' vaccination status.
• Providing easy access to the certificate through the mobile app.
Additionally, the app allows the user to book an appointment at the nearest vaccination 
centre effortlessly. When the QR code is scanned by our inbuilt or any QR scanner, a
link to the VMS smart vaccination card is presented, which includes complete user 
details along with the full vaccination details. When it comes to the staff and admins, 
they are provided with a web application that displays a dashboard based on their 
authorization level. There are mainly three different types of users, staff, admin, and 
citizens. Each has different kinds of interaction with the application.
